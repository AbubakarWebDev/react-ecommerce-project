# React E-Commerce Project

This repository hosts a React-based E-Commerce application. The project demonstrates the implementation of a complete online shopping platform, including product listings, shopping cart functionality, and state management.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Listings**: Display a list of products with details such as name, price, and description.
- **Shopping Cart Management**: Add, remove, and update products in the cart.
- **State Management**: Efficient state handling using Context API or Redux.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular design for scalability and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbubakarWebDev/react-ecommerce-project.git
   cd react-ecommerce-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## Key Components

- **ProductList**: Displays all available products.
- **ProductDetail**: Shows detailed information about a selected product.
- **Cart**: Manages and displays items added to the shopping cart.
- **Header/Footer**: Persistent layout components.

## State Management

This application uses Context API (or Redux, if specified) to handle state efficiently. It provides global access to the cart and product state.

### Example: Cart Context

```javascript
import { createContext, useReducer } from 'react';

const CartContext = createContext();

const initialState = {
  items: [],
};

function cartReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_ITEM':
      return { ...state, items: [...state.items, action.payload] };
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      return { ...state, items: state.items.filter(item => item.id !== action.payload) };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

export function CartProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(cartReducer, initialState);

  return (
    <CartContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </CartContext.Provider>
  );
}

export default CartContext;
```

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the fundamentals of React for building user interfaces.
- Manage global state using Context API or Redux.
- Build reusable and responsive UI components.
- Implement a basic shopping cart and product management system.
